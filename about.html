        <p class='about'>Hi,<br><br>
            I am Saad. I am a BCS student at UBC. This is the first Assignment-1 of the six assignments that for CPSC 455. I am very excited to take this course as it is a much welcome break from the usual theoratical stuff in a CS degree.
            In this assignment, I loved tinkering with CSS. It is so cool! For the project, we are making a a movie recommneder app that focuses on streaming content.
