        <p class='about'>Hi,
            I am Saad. I am a BCS student at UBC. This is the first Assignment-1 of the six assignments that for CPSC 455. I am very excited to take this course as it is a much welcome break from the usual theoratical stuff in a CS degree.
            In this assignment, I loved tinkering with CSS. It is so cool! 
        </p>
        <div class = 'about-button'>
        <button id="home-button" class = 'btn' >Home</button>

        <script type="text/javascript">
            document.getElementById("home-button").onclick = function () {
                location.href = "index.html";
            };
        </script>
        </div>
